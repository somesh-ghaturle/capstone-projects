            Return on Investment (ROI) measures the efficiency of an investment by comparing the gain or loss relative to the cost of the investment. It's expressed as a percentage and calculated using the formula:

            ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) × 100

            **Key Components:**
            • Net Profit: Total returns minus the initial investment cost
            • Cost of Investment: The total amount invested initially

            **Types of ROI:**
            • Simple ROI: Basic calculation for straightforward investments
            • Annualized ROI: Accounts for the time period of the investment
            • Risk-adjusted ROI: Considers the risk level of the investment

            **Factors Affecting ROI:**
            • Time horizon: Longer investments can compound returns
            • Risk tolerance: Higher risk often correlates with higher potential returns
            • Market conditions: Economic factors influence investment performance
            • Diversification: Spreading investments can stabilize overall returns

            **Important Considerations:**
            • ROI doesn't account for the time value of money
            • Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
            • Consider inflation and taxes when evaluating real returns
            • Compare ROI across similar investment types for meaningful analysis

            Remember: Higher ROI typically comes with higher risk. Always consider your investment goals and risk tolerance when making financial decisions.

            Important considerations:
            • Diversification across asset classes reduces risk
            • Time in market typically beats timing the market
            • Dollar-cost averaging helps reduce volatility impact
