2. Preventive Medicine: Focus on disease prevention, health promotion, and maintaining wellness through lifestyle modifications and screening.

3. Diagnostic Medicine: Identifying diseases and conditions through physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging, and other diagnostic tools.

4. Therapeutic Medicine: Treatment approaches including medications, surgery, rehabilitation, and other interventions to restore health.

5. Research Medicine: Advancing medical knowledge through clinical trials, basic research, and translational studies.

6. Specialty Medicine: Specialized fields such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, pediatrics, surgery, and many others.

Medical practice involves:
- Evidence-based decision making using the latest research and clinical guidelines
- Continuous learning and professional development
- Ethical patient care with respect for patient autonomy and dignity
- Collaborative healthcare delivery with multidisciplinary teams

Medicine combines scientific knowledge with practical application to improve human health outcomes and quality of life."""

2. Mental Health: Emotional, psychological, and social well-being affecting how we think, feel, and act.

3. Social Health: Ability to form satisfying interpersonal relationships and adapt to social environments.

Healthcare System Components:
- Primary care: First point of contact for routine health maintenance and common illnesses
- Secondary care: Specialist care and hospital services
- Tertiary care: Highly specialized care for complex conditions
- Preventive care: Services aimed at preventing illness and maintaining health

Factors Affecting Health:
- Genetics and biology
- Lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol use)

Types of Diabetes:

1. **Type 1 Diabetes**:
   - Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells
   - Usually diagnosed in children and young adults
   - Requires lifelong insulin therapy
   - Accounts for 5-10% of diabetes cases

2. **Type 2 Diabetes**:
   - Insulin resistance combined with relative insulin deficiency
   - Most common form (90-95% of cases)
   - Strongly associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle
   - May be managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, or insulin

3. **Gestational Diabetes**:
   - Develops during pregnancy
   - Usually resolves after delivery
   - Increases risk of type 2 diabetes later in life

4. **Other Types**:
   - Monogenic diabetes (MODY)
   - Secondary diabetes (due to other conditions or medications)

Symptoms:
- Frequent urination (polyuria)
- Increased thirst (polydipsia)
- Increased hunger (polyphagia)
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue
- Slow-healing sores
- Frequent infections
- Blurred vision
- Tingling or numbness in hands/feet

Diagnosis:
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL
- Oral glucose tolerance test (2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL)
- HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
- Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms

Management:
- **Lifestyle**: Healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management
- **Medications**: Metformin (first-line), sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists
- **Insulin therapy**: For type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes
- **Monitoring**: Regular blood glucose checks, HbA1c testing
- **Complications screening**: Annual eye exams, kidney function tests, foot exams

Complications:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy)
- Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy)
- Eye damage (diabetic retinopathy)
- Foot problems
- Skin conditions

Prevention (Type 2):
- Maintain healthy weight
- Regular physical activity
- Balanced diet
- Avoid smoking
- Regular health screenings"""
