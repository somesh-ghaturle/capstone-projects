Consider your time horizon, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Diversification helps manage risk but doesn't eliminate it. High-risk investments may offer higher returns but can result in significant losses. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.",

Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. Consider target-date funds for automatic diversification and rebalancing.

Key strategies include: staying calm and avoiding panic selling, maintaining long-term perspective, continuing regular contributions (dollar-cost averaging), rebalancing portfolios when appropriate, and focusing on quality investments. Market timing is extremely difficult and often counterproductive. Consider downturns as potential buying opportunities for long-term investors with adequate emergency funds.",
